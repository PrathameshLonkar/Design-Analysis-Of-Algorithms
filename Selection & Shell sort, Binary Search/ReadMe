To run the programs follow the steps:

1.) Open terminal in the folder
2.)run the commands: make
3.)To run either of the 3 problems type ./problem1 or ./problem2 or ./problem3

For selection sort i have taken reference from prof's pseudo code given in his video lectures.
For The 3rd problem I have used the binary search algorith to find the value as it has the time complexity of O(lgn)

I have given the explaination within the code using comments.

The folder has the following documents:

1.) Three .c files which are the solutions to the coding part.
2.)make file to run the codes as mentioned above
3.)A pdf contaning the answers to the Theory Questions
3.)A ReadMe.
